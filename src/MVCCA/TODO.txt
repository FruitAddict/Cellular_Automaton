TODO:

kiradess> but simple ones will be like: plants and animals. plants spawn randomly at the beginning, as do animals. animals move around randomly or whatever, they eat plants if they touch them.
<kiradess> if two animals come in contact, they reproduce. if an animal doesnt eat in x amount of time, it dies. x number of plants grow from its corpse
<kiradess> stuff like that
kiradess> like animals will randomly be assigned traits, like movement speed, lifespan, sense to move towards food/away from enemies, etc
<kiradess> and when two collide and reproduce, the offspring inherits some of those traits
<kiradess> survival of the fittest and all that
