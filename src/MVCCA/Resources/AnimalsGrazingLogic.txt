Green pixels represent grass, red pixels represent grazing animals. 
Grass is reproducing based on cellular automata rules with their chance of dying and staying alive customized (not always 100%).
If two animals meet, they reproduce creating another animal.
 If they step on grass, they eat it prolonging their lifespan. Each animal starts with 100 generation lifespan, eating grass prolongs it by 25.
